GAMEPLAY
  The object of this game is to uncover all the cards (#)
  in the pyramid. A card is uncovered when two selected cards
  equal 13.

  Cards may be selected two ways:
    1) by selecting the number of the corresponding card from
       the list, or
    2) by selecting the coordinate of the card - i.e. g22, etc.
       These methods may be mixed.

  Face card values are:
    A = 1
    T = 10
    J = 11
    Q = 12
    K = 13

  Scoring: two cards equalling 13 is two points; a King is one
    point.

  To remove a King from the pyramid, select only the King and
  press enter.

  To draw a card, press enter without any cards selected. To use
  the draw card, type 'x' along with a card you with to pair it
  with. If the draw card is a King, type 'x' and press enter.

  The score file is located at ~/.pyramid/score
